    <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
    <h5>A <i>potager</i>is a French term for an ornamental vegetable of kitchen garden. Often folowers (editble and non-editble) and herbs are
        planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically
        pleasing.</h5>

    <h2>What to Plant</h2>
    <h5>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Many are traind to grow uoward. A well-designed
    potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their funtion of providing
        for a home in a wide array of forms-from the carefree stule of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.</h5>
